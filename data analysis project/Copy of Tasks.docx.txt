Based on my observations, I recommend targeting countries that meet the criteria of having less competition and an average rating within the specified range. The rationale for focusing on average ratings is that lower satisfaction levels among customers may indicate opportunities for improvement. Conducting a market survey could help us understand the reasons behind customer dissatisfaction, allowing us to address these issues effectively when establishing new restaurants.
